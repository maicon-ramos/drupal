Compucorp Drupal Themer Test

Task 1: Drupal themeing

Link: https://maiconramos.com.br/open-charity/

Client: Open charity is an organisation that hosts events in London about open source software and solution for charities.

I've used some HTML5 semantics, some of the CSS3 transitions.
Dividing the theme in the same blocks of CMS Drupal,
The footer created 2 blocks (Social media and copyrights)
1 navigation menu with the logo and stylized the last link to look like a button
The rest I posted as a single page with full html

I used CSS preprocessor LESS, and mixed some CSS methodologies.
Prefer to use CSS FLEX to make a structure, for ease and fluency.

I used as the starting point the Framework 3 theme for Drupal 7.
Framework is a blank screen for theme developers.

Task 2: Extending a Bootstrap-based theme

Link: https://maiconramos.com.br/geek-label/

Client: Geek label is a new design agency that requires a new website.

I used it as a starting point for the Bootstrap Barrio theme for Drupal 7. With version 4 alpha of Bootstrap.

I used CSS preprocessor LESS, and mixed some CSS methodologies.
