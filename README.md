I've used some HTML5 semantics, some of the CSS3 transitions.
Dividing the theme in the same blocks of CMS Drupal,
The footer created 2 blocks (Social media and copyrights)
1 navigation menu with the logo and stylized the last link to look like a button
The rest I posted as a single page with full html

I used CSS preprocessor LESS, and mixed some CSS methodologies.
Prefer to use CSS FLEX to make a structure, for ease and fluency.

I used as the starting point the Framework 3 theme for Drupal 7.
Framework is a blank screen for theme developers.
